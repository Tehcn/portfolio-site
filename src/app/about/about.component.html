        <h2>Why I Program</h2>
        <p>TL;DR: I enjoyed Minecraft too much, so I wanted to make a game. Now, I can if want to.</p>
        <br />
        <p>I've always had a love for video games, and when I was 6, my dad bought me Xbox Live Gold to play Minecraft with our Xbox 360. I spent a <i>lot</i> of time playing Minecraft. Eventually, after I had gotten my own computer at the age of 10, I decided, after having seen many of DanTDM's Minecraft mod showcases, that I wanted not only to make a Minecraft mod, but that I wanted to make my own game. So, my dad bought me a learning platform called CodeKingdoms, which I highly reccommend to any beginners who like Minecraft, which had tutorials for making Minecraft "mods", which are actually plugins (still pretty cool though!). It tought me the very basic fundamentals of programming like methods, loops, conditionals, varibles, and more. Then I took a break from programming. Somrtime later, when I was 12, I started to program again, but this time I was learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript through a platform called SoloLearn, which I also greatly reccommend. After that, I was off. If I wanted to make something and didn't have the technical skills, I learned them. Now, I'm here writing this. So, here we are.</p>
