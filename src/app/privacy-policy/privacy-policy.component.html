    <h2>TL;DR: No data is collected</h2>
    <p>I mean, seriously what data could I actually collect? I don't want to go through the painful process of data collection. So, I won't! Simple as that! For you smart cookies out there who went and checked and saw two "cookies" those are put there by default by your browser. They don't actually do anything. I can't remove them. Sorry.</p>
